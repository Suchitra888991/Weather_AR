# AR Weather App

A standard weather app, provides tracking of current weather conditions and weather forecast for
the given particular location in real time. We are developing a weather app, to provide better
visualisation using Augmented Reality as well as providing better user experience. This app could
be a more dependable and effective pre-disaster information transmission system that might improve
public emergency responses and allow individuals to evacuate and take protective measures before
and during a disaster.
